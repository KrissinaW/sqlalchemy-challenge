# **Background**: 

**It's About Time!**

I have decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. 

To help with my trip planning, I have decided to do a climate analysis about the area. 

The following sections outline the steps that I took to accomplish this task.

# **Instructions:**

**Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data**

In this section, I will use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database. Specifically, i'll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. To do so, complete the following steps:

- Iâ€™ll use the provided files (climate_starter.ipynb and hawaii.sqlite) to complete the climate analysis and data exploration.

- Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to the SQLite database.

- Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.

- Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
